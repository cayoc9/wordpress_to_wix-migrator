"""
Redirect generation utilities for the WordPress â†’ Wix migration.

This module provides a helper function, :func:`generate_redirects_csv`,
to create a CSV file mapping old WordPress post URLs to their new
locations on the Wix site.  The resulting CSV is suitable for use with
Wix's bulk redirect import tool.

The function handles both full URLs (if an ``old_domain`` is provided)
and relative paths.  It correctly constructs the source and target paths
for the redirect map.

Usage example::

    from src.utils.redirects import generate_redirects_csv

    migrated_posts = [
        {"Slug": "post-one", "Permalink": "http://old.com/2023/01/post-one/", "NewURL": "https://new.wix.com/post/post-one"},
        {"Slug": "post-two", "Permalink": "http://old.com/2023/02/post-two/", "NewURL": "https://new.wix.com/post/post-two"},
    ]

    generate_redirects_csv(migrated_posts, old_domain="old.com", new_base="https://new.wix.com")

This will produce a file named ``redirects.csv`` with the following
content::

    Source Path,Target Path
    /2023/01/post-one/,/post/post-one
    /2023/02/post-two/,/post/post-two
