Error reporting utilities for the WordPress â†’ Wix migration.

This module provides a simple mechanism for recording structured errors
during the migration process.  Each error is associated with a unique
code (e.g., ``MEDIA_UPLOAD``, ``WIX_DRAFT_400``) and includes the
original post data that caused the failure, along with any relevant
exception information.  Successful operations can also be logged using
:func:`report_ok`.

All errors and successes are stored in the global ``ERRORS`` dictionary,
keyed by post slug.  This allows for easy generation of a summary report
at the end of the migration, detailing which posts succeeded, which
failed, and why.

Usage example::

    from src.utils.errors import report_error, report_ok, ERRORS

    post = {"Slug": "my-first-post", ...}
    try:
        # ... perform some operation ...
        report_ok("DRAFT_CREATED", post, {"draft_id": "123"})
    except Exception as e:
        report_error("WIX_NETWORK", post, e)

    # Later, to generate a report:
    for slug, entries in ERRORS.items():
        print(f"Post: {slug}")
        for entry in entries:
            print(f"  - {entry['status']}: {entry['code']}")
            if entry.get('error'):
                print(f"    {entry['error']}")
